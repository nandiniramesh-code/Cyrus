          <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
            The Cyrus Foundation is dedicated to promoting sustainable agriculture practices that improve food security, 
            protect the environment, and enhance livelihoods in rural communities. We believe that agriculture is not just 
            about growing foodâ€”it's about nurturing communities and fostering environmental stewardship.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Through innovative farming techniques, education, and community collaboration, we help create resilient 
            agricultural systems that can withstand changing climate conditions while providing nutritious food and 
            economic opportunities.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              We train farmers in agroecological methods that maintain soil health, conserve water, and reduce dependence 
              on chemical inputs. These practices include crop rotation, companion planting, natural pest management, 
              and composting, resulting in healthier harvests and lower production costs.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              In regions facing water scarcity, we provide access to drought-resistant seed varieties and training on 
              water-efficient farming techniques. These initiatives help farmers adapt to changing climate conditions 
              while maintaining productive harvests.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              We establish community-managed seed banks that preserve local crop diversity and ensure farmers have 
              access to high-quality seeds. These banks serve as living libraries of agricultural biodiversity and 
              reduce farmers' dependence on commercial seed markets.

              Our hands-on learning approach brings farmers together to share knowledge, experiment with new techniques, 
              and learn from each other. These schools serve as innovation centers where traditional wisdom meets modern 
              sustainable practices.

              We help small-scale farmers access fair markets by establishing cooperatives, providing training in 
              post-harvest handling, and creating connections with buyers who value sustainably grown produce. 
              These efforts help farmers receive better prices for their crops.

            <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
              In Nyamira County, we worked with 200 farming families to introduce agroforestry techniques that integrate 
              fruit trees with annual crops. Within three years, participating farms saw a 40% increase in overall 
              productivity and a 50% increase in household income from diversified crops.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The success of this program has led to its adoption in neighboring communities, creating a ripple effect

              Our women's farming collective in Tamil Nadu has empowered 150 women to establish organic vegetable gardens 
              that provide both nutrition for their families and income through local markets. The collective has become 
              a powerful voice for sustainable agriculture in the region and a model for gender equity in farming.
